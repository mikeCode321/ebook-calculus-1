# Factoring and Fractions

## Factoring
When we want to expand an expression in factored form we "un-multiply." This is often useful when trying to simplify an expression. Another way to put it is reversing the distributive law.

There are essentially 2 fundamental ways of expanding an expression. One of which is to directly remove a common factor from each of the terms in the expression. 

```{note}
A **term(s)** is the building block of an algebraic expression. It can be:
- A **constant**: A fixed number without any variables (e.g., \( 5 \)).
- A **variable**: A symbol representing an unknown value (e.g., \( x \)).
- The **product** of numbers and variables (e.g., \( 3x \) or \( 2x^2 \)).
```

### Removing Common Factors

(1) $ab + ac = a(b + c)$ <br>
(2) $-a-b = -(a + b)$ <br>
(3) $(a-b) = -(b - a)$ <br>

Notice that in the above expressions we are removing common factors such as **a** from expression 1 and **-** which is -1 from expressions 2 and 3. The 3rd expressions negative sign (-1) is factored out to reverse the order of subtraction, turning (a − b) into −(b − a). 

As a training exercise try distributing the common factor we took out on the right side of the expression (i.e., a(b+c)) and see if you end up with the left side of the expression. 

### Exercises 
(1) Simplify: $\frac{2}{3}x^{2}y + \frac{4}{3}xy$

```{dropdown} Answer
  $\frac{2}{3}xy(x + 2)$
```

(2) Simplify: $(2x + 1)x^3 - 3x(2x + 1)$

```{dropdown} Answer
  $(2x + 1)(x^3 - 3x)$ = $x(x^2 - 3)(2x + 1)$
```

(3) Simplify: $-\frac{s^{2}t}{8w} - \frac{st^{2}}{16w}$

```{dropdown} Answer
  $-\frac{st}{8w}(s + \frac{t}{2})$
```

### Grouping Terms
There will be scenarios where all terms in an expression won't have a common factor. What you can try to do first is; visually inspect the expression and group terms that are able to produce a common factor.

**Example:** <br>
$x^{2} - hx - x + h$ = $(x^{2} - hx) - (x - h)$ = $x(x - h) - (x - h)$ = $(x - h)(x - 1)$

### Exercises 
(1) Simplify: $-\frac{s^{2}t}{8w} - \frac{st^{2}}{16w}$

```{dropdown} Answer
  $-\frac{st}{8w}(s + \frac{t}{2})$
```

(2) Simplify: $x^{5}y^{2} + 2y^{3} + 2x^{5} + 4y$

```{dropdown} Answer
  $y^2(x^{5} + 2y) + (2x^{5} + 4y)$ = $y^2(x^{5} + 2y) + 2(x^{5} + 2y)$ = $(x^{5} + 2y)(y^{2} + 2)$
```
