    "MyST stands for \"Markedly Structured Text\". It\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,\n",
    "the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like\n",
    "this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:\n",
    "The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to\n",
    "render properly.\n",
    "For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,\n",
    "then the bibliography is inserted with:\n",
