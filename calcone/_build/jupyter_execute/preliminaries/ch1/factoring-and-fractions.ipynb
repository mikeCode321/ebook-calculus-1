    "## Factoring\n",
    "When we want to expand an expression in factored form we \"un-multiply.\" This is often useful when trying to simplify an expression. Another way to put it is reversing the distributive law.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially 2 fundamental ways of expanding an expression. One of which is to directly remove a common factor from each of the terms in the expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A **term(s)** is the building block of an algebraic expression. It can be:\n",
    "- A **constant**: A fixed number without any variables (e.g., \\( 5 \\)).\n",
    "- A **variable**: A symbol representing an unknown value (e.g., \\( x \\)).\n",
    "- The **product** of numbers and variables (e.g., \\( 3x \\) or \\( 2x^2 \\)).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing Common Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) $ab + ac = a(b + c)$ <br>\n",
    "(2) $-a-b = -(a + b)$ <br>\n",
    "(3) $(a-b) = -(b - a)$ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the above expressions we are removing common factors such as **a** from expression 1 and **-** which is -1 from expressions 2 and 3. The 3rd expressions negative sign (-1) is factored out to reverse the order of subtraction, turning (a − b) into −(b − a). \n",
    "\n",
    "As a training exercise try distributing the common factor we took out on the right side of the expression (i.e., a(b+c)) and see if you end up with the left side of the expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises \n",
    "(1) Simplify: $\\frac{2}{3}x^{2}y + \\frac{4}{3}xy$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} Answer\n",
    "  $\\frac{2}{3}xy(x + 2)$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Simplify: $(2x + 1)x^3 - 3x(2x + 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} Answer\n",
    "  $(2x + 1)(x^3 - 3x)$ = $x(x^2 - 3)(2x + 1)$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Simplify: $-\\frac{s^{2}t}{8w} - \\frac{st^{2}}{16w}$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} Answer\n",
    "  $-\\frac{st}{8w}(s + \\frac{t}{2})$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grouping Terms\n",
    "There will be scenarios where all terms in an expression won't have a common factor. What you can try to do first is; visually inspect the expression and group terms that are able to produce a common factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** <br>\n",
    "$x^{2} - hx - x + h$ = $(x^{2} - hx) - (x - h)$ = $x(x - h) - (x - h)$ = $(x - h)(x - 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises \n",
    "(1) Simplify: $-\\frac{s^{2}t}{8w} - \\frac{st^{2}}{16w}$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} Answer\n",
    "  $-\\frac{st}{8w}(s + \\frac{t}{2})$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Simplify: $x^{5}y^{2} + 2y^{3} + 2x^{5} + 4y$\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} Answer\n",
    "  $y^2(x^{5} + 2y) + (2x^{5} + 4y)$ = $y^2(x^{5} + 2y) + 2(x^{5} + 2y)$ = $(x^{5} + 2y)(y^{2} + 2)$\n",
