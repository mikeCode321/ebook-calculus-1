# Calculus I: Engineering Calculations with Python 

This ebook is intended to be a self-paced interactive experience, that captures all of Calculus I with numerous examples in increasing difficulty. Answers will be there under each problem to help guide you to mastering this art. 

In this eBook, you'll explore Calculus I in tandem with its applications in the computational world. Python will be the primary programming language used to demonstrate practical solutions to Calculus problems, while also enabling the creation of interactive visualizations.

## What To Expect:
- To get the most out of the code examples, you should have an intermediate understanding of programming concepts.

- The eBook will begin with a set of preliminary chapters that cover both basic and advanced Pre-Calculus topics before the core material is presented.

- As you work through the book, you'll have the opportunity to experiment with code, run examples, and visualize concepts in real-time using Python.
